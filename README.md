#This is to show what my project is about

This website is fairly simple, and just shows what zodiac animal you are based on the year that you put 
It's slightly fyunny and slightly interactive, mainly with some of the pictures that you can press that are actually links that take you to
each animal's info page, there are 12 which were gruesome to do......
Each one of those pages has buttons that can be pressede again to toggle on or off info

In my code I asked ai to help me in various situations, the main one being how to use a sperate css file, because I originally had no formality with it.
In some cases logic, how to use things like "element" in the javascript and fixing how to reset my code. My code had an error where the link of one animal would stay even though you typed in another animal's year to be displayed.

Other than that most things were written on my own, slight syntax here and there.

The things like the az html and  doghtml are all kind of just the layouts of the program.
az is the first thing you should see when you run the program, it has the calculator for which year correlates to which animal that you are
The other Dog, rat, ox, etc html links are just more in depth info pages based on which year you put.
